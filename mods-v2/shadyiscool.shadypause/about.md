# ShadyPause

## What does it do? 
It toggles the pause menu when you press Z. Can be toggled in the mod settings.

## How many lines of code did this take?
33, and that's with the brackets each on new lines. I could lower it to something like 25 lines if I really wanted.

## Wow what a cool mod, how can I support you?
The only support you need to give is to your family.
