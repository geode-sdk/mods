# MainMenuWallpaper

Allows you to set your own wallpaper on MenuLayer.

Wallpaper image is stored at "iristraa.mainmenuwallpaper" in texture packs,...
or "[GD Installation folder]/geode/unzipped/iristraa.mainmenuwallpaper/resources/iristraa.mainmenuwallpaper".

### TODO:
 - Android support
 - "Tile" fit type
 - Cool new mod icon :D

## Different fit types
1. Fill: Image is scaled (aspect ratio maintained) to fill the entire screen.
2. Fit: Entire image is scaled (aspect ratio maintained) to fit into the screen.
3. Stretch: Image is stretched to fit the entire screen. Might result in lower quality wallpapers.
4. Center: Image is in the center of the screen, unscaled.

## How to set your own wallpaper

### 1. Texture Loader installed (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WAY)

 - Make a folder called "iristraa.mainmenuwallpaper" inside one of your enabled texture packs
 - Add your own "wallpaper.png" file - corresponding to your texture quality
 - Done :)

### 2. No Texture Loader
 - Go to "[GD Installation folder]/geode/unzipped/iristraa.mainmenuwallpaper/resources/iristraa.mainmenuwallpaper"
 - Replace the "wallpaper.png" file corresponding to your texture quality
 - Done :)
