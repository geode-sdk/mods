# FLIKK2GD
(Just a prewarning: I don't blame you if you've never heard of FLIKK, it's a game my friend made and this mod really isn't going to be useful to many people)

But with that out of the way,

Have you ever wanted to play your FLIKK levels in Geometry Dash?
Well now you can, with FLIKK2GD!

Simply open the editor, go to the edit tab and click that shiny new FLIKK button to get started.
It even supports loading from a .FLKK file or even an online level!
