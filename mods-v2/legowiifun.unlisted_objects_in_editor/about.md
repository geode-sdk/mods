# Unlisted objects in editor

Adds several unlisted objects to the appropriate tabs in the level editor. Massive thanks to NicknameGG for the tutorial on adding objects to new editor tabs, as shown here: https://github.com/NicknameGG/The-intense-adding-of-a-new-object-in-a-new-tab. If you know of other unlisted objects that you want in the mod, or if there is a bug that needs fixed, let me know at https://github.com/legowiifun/Geometry-Dash-Unlisted-Objects-in-Editor.
