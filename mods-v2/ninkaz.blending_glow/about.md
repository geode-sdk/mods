Makes player's glow blending like how it was pre-2.2.

Doesn't work on the robot and spider due to technical limitations, but those two gamemodes weren't blending in 2.1 either so it's fine.

## Options

- Blending glow: enable/disable blending glow without needing to restart
- Brighter glow: increases glow brightness by 1.5x to emulate the glow color pre-2.2
