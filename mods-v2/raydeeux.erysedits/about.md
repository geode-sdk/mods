# ErysEdits
Several mods I would've made into smaller standalone mods when I was an ignorant Geode developer. (And I still probably am by several accounts, but who's keeping track? `/j`)

Not all features of ErysEdits are available (or behave the same way) across all platforms; check your settings for this mod after installing to verify.

## Features
- Various Info Label tweaks, including improved readibility, conditional displays, and debug text logging

- Viewing level descriptions from level lists and daily/weekly levels (compatible with nearly every possible mod that edits the LevelCell, including Cvolton's BetterInfo + Compact Level Lists, cdc's Level Thumbnails, n's Level Pronouns, and dankmeme's Globed)
