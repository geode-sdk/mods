# DarkMode

This mod is a [Geode] port of old patch by [Absolute] made for [RedHuseey]'s [Dark Mode GD texture pack].

## But it has *settings*

Check out mod's settings, the default values are set to have same values as [Absolute]'s [DarkMode Patcher] patches.

### TODO:

- ensure there is no crashes
- compatibility with other mods
- level name and description inputs backgrounds
- level share description
- level loading play button background
- platformer controls settings background
- lists progress bars
- map packs progress bars
- chest background
- chest platforms (in the basement)
- shop colors
- gauntlet colors
- leaderboard highlight color
