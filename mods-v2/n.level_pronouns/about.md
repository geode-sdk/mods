## Overview

The "Level Pronouns" mod enhances your gaming environment by adding pronouns to individual levels. Now, every level can have its own identity, thanks to the following pronouns:

**Binary Pronouns:**

- She/Her
- He/Him
- They/Them
- He/They
- She/They
- It/Its
- Any/All

**Neopronouns:**

In addition to traditional pronouns, this mod introduces neopronouns for a more diverse experience. Neopronouns are unique and personal pronoun sets, and they include:

- Ze/Hir
- Ze/Zir
- Xe/Xem
- E/Eir
- Ey/Em
- Per/Per

## Customization

We understand that not everyone may want to use neopronouns. That's why we give you the power to decide. You can enable or disable neopronouns in the Geode Settings menu for this mod.

In case you want the text from the Level Cell to be white, you can enable the "White Text" option in the Geode Settings menu for this mod.

## Probability

To maintain balance and diversity, the mod randomly assigns pronouns to levels. We aim for a more inclusive and representative gaming experience, so the probability of neopronouns being assigned to a level is set at 20%.

Now, every level in your game can have its own unique identity and pronoun, making your gaming experience more immersive and inclusive.

## TODO
* Make levels have multiple pronouns
