# RobTop Bot

The worst bot ever made, now at your fingertips...

Did you know that Geometry Dash comes with a bot ever since version 1.6? The only issue is that it's only available to RobTop himself - the game automatically records all inputs for every level verification and RobTop then has the ability to play them back. This mod adds the ability to play these back for your own editor levels and use this built-in functionality to record replays for online levels.

**This mod can taint your save file** - enabling the option to record replays for online levels stores these in your CCGameManager.dat. This option is disabled by default though.
