# LevelInfo

A simple and customizable mod that displays information about the level you are on such as the requested difficulty by its creator, its featured rank, its object count, the version in which the level was created, how many updates the level received, what was the original ID of the copied level, if the level is using two player mode, how much time the creator(s) of the level spent in the editor (and also with copies), how many attempts you have on the level, how many times you jumped and clicked in the level and what was your best run.

Pretty much everything can be enabled/disabled, even the text color can be customized!

### Why did you make this?

I was bored, so I made this for fun. I also wanted to learn a bit about C++, since I had never tried this language before (which also means the code might be unoptimized, so feel free to make pull requests, it would really help!).
