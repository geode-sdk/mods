**by [Jouca](user:7026949) and [Firee](user:6253758)**
A Geometry Dash Mod for adding more tools such as Notifications, auto-song mute, game fixes & more!
![Mod Example](gdutilsdevs.gdutils/Screenshot_1.png)
# Features
## Realtime Notifications
* This includes any new levels being **rated**, new **daily levels**, and new **weekly levels!**
* This also includes the new difficulty faces, and the new **Legendary** and **Mythic** rating.
* Notifications are **highly customizable**, you can set the __position__, __size__, and __how long they can stay on screen!__
* You can also set when notifications **should appear** or **not appear**! This includes __being shown in levels__, __in the editor__, __etc__.
## Auto-Mute Spotify (or any application)
* Allows you to **auto mute Spotify** when you are __playing a level__, __playtesting in the editor__, and more!
* You're also able to set **any application** to be muted, not just Spotify!
* **IMPORTANT for Mac Users:** Geometry Dash may request access to "System Events" and another app for muting Spotify or another application. This allows the game to detect running applications.
## Level URL Sharing Feature (Windows Only)
* You can share levels easily by copying the URL of it and sending it to your friends! Or you can quickly go to a level by going to `https://gdutils.com/{levelid}` (Replacing `{levelid}` with the ID of the level)
## Extra additions to Friends List
* The additions added include being able to **search usernames** if you have a long friend list, or using the **scroll buttons**!
## More Leaderboards
* Thanks to Updated Leaderboards, it's now possible for you to view leaderboards for users with the most **Moons**, **Diamonds**, **User Coins**, and **Demons!**
## Moderator List 
* You can view the list of **Elder Moderators**/**Moderators** and their socials!
## Moderator Info
* You can view a description of either the Moderator, Elder Moderator, or other badges users have by clicking on the badge itself on the profile!
## View Demon List Placement
* Instead of having to go to Pointercrate to view the demon placement of a level, you can now **view the position** of an extreme demon!
