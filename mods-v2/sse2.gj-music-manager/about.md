# Music Manager

Replace and randomize music without changing the original files. Compatible with Mega Hack and textureldr!

## How to use

Create a "music-manager" directory inside your Geometry Dash root. Create a folder with the name of the track you want to change (see below for caveats). Put the replacement tracks inside the folder (name and format don't matter, just make sure you only have sounds inside the folder or else things might break).

## Caveats

Because Geode isn't fully complete, not all tracks and no SFX can be replaced (yet).

## Supported replacement tracks:
- menuLoop.mp3
- shop.mp3
- shop2.mp3
- shop3.mp3
- shop4.mp3
- shop5.mp3
- secretShop.mp3
- secretLoop.mp3
- secretLoop02.mp3
- secretLoop03.mp3
- tower01.mp3
- maybe more?
