# Happy Textures :3

A mod that will fix small texture annoyances

Current features include:

- Having a separate image for the title on the Menu Layer by adding GJ_title.png in your resources
- Replacing bigFont does not affect levels anymore
- CCScale9Sprite no longer has texture overlap issues (Transparent textures in the level search look good now :3)

Feature requests welcome, DM me @Alphalaneous on Discord
