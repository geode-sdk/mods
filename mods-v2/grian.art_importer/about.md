# How to use:

There is a button in the edit menu, click that and then you will be instructed to search for a image to import.
I recommend creating your pixel art on a site like [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite) and then exporting it as a png.
I do not recommend importing large images on low end devices as the game might lag/crash.
There is a limited size currently a 200 x 200 pixel limit which will be increased over time as I make the mod more object efficent.

# Find any bugs:

Report bugs to me on discord in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cdYcFRgASf) or message me Geck_.
I am new to Geometry Dash modding so thats why it may have bugs.

# Credits:

Makes use of a single file image libaray for reading the images [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
Also want to give credit to GD cologne for the idea as he made a similar mod years ago.
