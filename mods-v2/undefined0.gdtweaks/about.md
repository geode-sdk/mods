Miscellaneous things to change the game if you want, dunno really:
- Skew the title text
- Replace newgrounds with geode
- Remove map packs
- Remove corners
- Remove the level select topper
- Fix the joystick indicator
- Move the betterinfo button
- Replace "More Games" with a texture pack selector
- FIRE IN THE HOLE

and more...
(make sure to use that shiny settings button in the corner)
