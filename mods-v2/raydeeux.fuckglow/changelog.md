# FrickGlow Changelog
## v1.3.4
- Rename the mod ID per the Geode index's new anti-profanity guidelines.
## v1.3.3
- macOS support! Yay!
- Option 1 of "Hide Glow Deco" is no longer exclusive to Windows.
## v1.3.2
- Fix a conflict with Weebify's Coins in Pause Menu mod, and hopefully all other mods in the future.
## v1.3.1
- *Finally* manage to resolve the incredibly rare incompat with Capeling's Gamemode Swapper mod. If anyone was curious what it was, FrickGlow would sometimes mistakenly hide the player if a level started with a mini-sized player (regardless of Testmode status). Sorry for putting you through the update fatigue!
## v1.3.0
- Refactor return type responsible for skipping objects, because alk is (rightfully) allergic to `TodoReturn` return types. Regardless of whether or not you understood the previous sentence, almost nothing changes for you, the enduser.
- Fix a trailing comma at one of the lists.
- Bring back (toggleable) original methods of hiding glow in light of levels such as Tether Trials by choccymilk15 and Space Invaders by Manix and LazerBlitz.
## v1.2.0
- Renaming per new Geode mod naming guidelines.
## v1.1.0
- Remove conflict with Capeling's Gamemode Swapper mod. As a consequence, macOS support removed.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release.
