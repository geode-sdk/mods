Is your hand tired of hitting the Z key every time you want to place a checkpoint?
Do you wish there was an easier way to place checkpoints without having to think?
Do you just want to place a checkpoint down every frame because why not?

If the answer to any of those questions was a resounding yes, then I have the thing for you.
Introducing: AutoCheckpoint!

This places down checkpoints (wow, what a suprise) based on things like
- If you just hit a portal
- If you just got reversed
- If you change size
And more!

Just make sure to hit that shiny settings button down there (once downloaded) to customise the settings to your liking.

Happy Checkpointing!
