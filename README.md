# Mods

This is the public **Mods Index** for Geode. The mods listed here will show up on the in-game list as part of the Geode API, and users can download & install mods that appear here through that list.

## Getting your mod here

To get your mod listed on the repository, [open a pull request](https://github.com/geode-sdk/mods/compare). We require a copy of the mod's source code so we can verify the mod adheres to our [modding guidelines](https://geode-sdk.github.io/docs/guidelines.html), and we will build the mod that will be released on this repository from the source code ourselves.
