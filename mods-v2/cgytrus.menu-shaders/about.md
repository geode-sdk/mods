# Menu Shaders
Replaces the background of the main menu with a custom shader, which can be customized.

This is a port of mat's [Menu Shaders](https://github.com/matcool/small-gd-mods/blob/3e1783c7e281cbbccd53f9c4ceb697d5a6f839dd/src/menu-shaders.cpp) mod.

## Usage
To customize the shader, create a file named menu-shader.fsh in your Resources folder with the shader you want.
For a few already made shaders, checkout this ~~Twitter~~ X [thread](https://twitter.com/mateus44_/status/1412108556921344006?s=20).

If you want to convert shaders from shadertoy yourself you can try using Tning's [Shadertoy porter](https://shadertoyporter.github.io/), but be aware that not every shader will work.
