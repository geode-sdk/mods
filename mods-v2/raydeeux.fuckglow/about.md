# FrickGlow
Ever wondered what Geometry Dash levels would look like without glow? Here you go!

Made with much-appreciated help from:
\- TechStudent10 (massive refactor)
\- cgytrus and matcool (meaningful function hooking)
\- dankmeme01 and Firee (CCSprite hiding strategy + general C++ syntax wrangling)
\- ItsLever (disabling Gradient trigger strategy)
\- poweredbypie (Gradient trigger conditional statement code golf)

Disclaimers:
\- This mod is no longer available for macOS.
\- This does not affect overall game performance; the glows are simply invisible.
