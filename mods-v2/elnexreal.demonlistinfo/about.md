# Demonlist User Info

This is a mod that allows you to see the top of the current user you are watching.

## Notes

* Game crashes if you open and close the user profile page too fast (probably it will be fixed in an update)
* Stats may not be accurate, this happens because Pointercrate's API its weird and i searches for display name instead of the username of the GD account (plz Pointercrate don't do that anymore)
