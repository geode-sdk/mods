# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

It is very much in beta, and you may experience some issues, especially if you live far from the server location. For optimal experience, make sure to update the mod whenever available, so you get all the latest bugfixes.

## Usage

In the main menu you should see an extra button at the bottom. It will open the Globed Menu, where you can see a list of servers that you can join.

## Central server configuration

The default URL is http://globed.dankmeme.dev

If you want to change the URL of the Central Server, open the Globed Menu and press the gear button in bottom left. Here you can enter any valid HTTP(s) URL, and after pressing 'apply', the active server will switch to the one you entered.
