# <cr> GDDL Integration </c>

Displays <cr>**GDDL tiers**</c> next to demon ratings as well as the reported <cb>enjoyment</c> ratings.  
Click on the rating button (the red square) to see information about enjoyment and the amount of ratings.

![Example (that'll show up once you download it)](b1rtek.gddlintegration/tier.png)

If the rating doesn't load, <cb>refresh</c> the level page (It happens sometimes if you have the level saved already).  
The button can be moved to the level name (there's a setting for that)

You can search for levels based on their tier or enjoyment rating, completion status etc. in the new GDDL Search menu

![Example of the new search menu](b1rtek.gddlintegration/search.png)

Adds a button on your profile that shows how many demons of each tier you've beaten

## Known issues

- <cy>Usernames</c> sometimes turn into <cy>`-`</c> after a <cr>failed</c> request, this is just cosmetic though (
  [apparently Rob's fault](https://github.com/geode-sdk/indexer/issues/557#issuecomment-1913375319))
- Opening the *GDDL Demon Split* popup <co>might</c> cause a lag, don't worry about that :)
- Going back from the *GDDL Search* popup goes back to the creator layer instead of the search layer
- The level browser might display a button which should allow you to go to the next page of results even though there might be no more pages

If you encounter any other issues, contact me on Discord (<cb>@b1rtek</c>) or on Github
