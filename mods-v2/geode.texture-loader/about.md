# Texture Loader

A texture pack manager for Geode.

The UI for the mod can be accessed in the main menu. There you can open the packs folder by clicking on the folder icon.

You can **drag** on the small plus icon to move packs from available to applied, and back and forth.

## Adding Packs
You may add packs by adding folders, zip files or apk files. Press the folder button on the pack select screen to open the directory where you should place the packs.

**On Android** This button doesn't currently work. Manually go place your packs at `/storage/0/Android/media/com.geode.launcher/game/geode/config/geode.texture-loader/packs/`

## For Pack Creators

We have special features for packs, such as pack icons. Please [read our readme for more information](https://github.com/geode-sdk/textureldr)
